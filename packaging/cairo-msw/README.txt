This folder contains Cairo header files and DLLs for Windows, which enable
building Cairo support in wxWidgets on Windows, (in wx.GraphicsContext) as
well as using Cairo from Python, integrated with wxPython using the
wx.lib.wxcairo package. The DLLs will be included by default in the builds for
Windows.

These files were originally extracted from the installers available from the
following locations:

    http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/home/index.php/Main/Downloads
    https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer
